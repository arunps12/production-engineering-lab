# Learn Python — Complete Hands-On Guide

**Author:** Arun
**Goal:** Build real Python fluency — from zero to confident, job-ready developer
**Mode:** Execution-Based Learning (Theory → Practice → Debug → Build)

---

## How to Use This Guide

1. Work through each section **in order** — each one builds on the previous.
2. Read the **THEORY** first. Understanding *why* something works matters more than memorizing syntax.
3. **Type every exercise yourself.** Don't copy-paste. Your fingers need to learn the patterns.
4. Complete **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Real-World** exercises progressively.
5. When you get stuck, **debug before Googling.** Section 3 teaches you how.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- A terminal (Linux/macOS/WSL2)
- A text editor or VS Code
- Curiosity and willingness to break things

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Guide

- Write clean, readable Python code that other developers can maintain
- Design programs using classes, modules, and proper project structure
- **Debug any error** — read stack traces, trace variables, fix logic bugs
- Work with files (CSV, JSON) and call external REST APIs
- Handle edge cases, errors, and unexpected input gracefully
